                <h1>Post Pigeon</h1>
                <p>Post Pigeon is a site that allows you to create and share posts with other people.</p>
                <p>You could use it to say, write a <a href="https://post-pigeon.com/posts/33d947e3-2fdb-5e96-9a87-7d09a19ac729">blog post</a>, share a <a href="https://post-pigeon.com/posts/db289811-2548-57f8-ba90-dfd488955a96">recipe</a> or whatever else you care to.</p>
                <p>Neither you or anyone you share your post with needs an account to publish or view content. In fact, there are no accounts on Post Pigeon.</p>
                <p>We dont track you, and there's no way to promote any content. With Post Pigeon you can write a post, share it with others, and delete it. That's it. </p>
                <p>The code is open source and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/jtanza/post-pigeon">here</a></p>

                <br>
                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                <p>Post Pigeon is composed of two features: creating posts and deleting them.</p>
                <p>All "authorization" on these actions is achieved through delegation to digital signatures; all posts uploaded are cryptographically signed and only the holder of the keys used to sign the message is able to subsequently delete it.</p>

                <h5>Creating a Post</h5>
                <p>To publish a post users will need to either <a href="#command_new_keys">generate new keys</a>, or use an existing pair to <a href="#command_prepare_post">sign their post content</a>.</p>
                <p>Once the signature has been created, the key, along with the signed content and the plaintext post file can be <a href="/new">published</a>.</p>

                <p>Behind the scenes, we ensure the signature is valid, generate and store some HTML and publish your post to Post Pigeon for you to share.</p>

                <h5>Deleting a Post</h5>
                <p>To delete a post, simply re-sign the original, <strong>unaltered</strong> post content <strong>with the same key used to originally sign it</strong> and <a href="/delete">provide</a> the post <a href="#content_uuids">UUID</a> and signed content.</p>
                <p>It should be made explicit here: if you lose the original key pair used to first sign the post <strong>you will not be able to delete it.</strong></p>
                <p>Given this, we provide an option to set an expiration value when fist publishing your post. If this value is set, it will be auto-deleted when that expiration is met. <strong>Strongly consider this option if you are apt to lose your keys.</strong></p>

                <br>
                <h2>Some Helpful Commands</h2>
                <p>Below are a few commands you can use to help prepare a post for upload.</p>
                <p>Prerequisites include <code>openssl</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>basenc</code>, and <code>sha256sum</code>. All others <i>should</i> already be on your (*nix based) system.</p>

                <div id="command_new_keys">
                    <h5>Generating Keys</h5>
                    <p>Post Pigeon uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a> based keys for verification; in order to submit a post with Post Pigeon it must be signed with an ECDSA key. You can of course generate the keys any way you'd like, but an example using <code>openssl</code> is provided here.</p>
                    <pre>$ # generate your private key&#13;&#10;$ openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -noout -out postpigeon-priv-key.pem&#13;&#10;$ # generate your public key from your private key&#13;&#10;$ openssl ec -in postpigeon-priv-key.pem -pubout > postpigeon-pub-key.pem</pre>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div id="command_prepare_post">
                    <h5>Preparing a post</h5>
                    <p>In order to submit a post on Post Pigeon we need the Base64 encoded digital signature</p>
                    <p>The example below writes our post into a file called <code>data.txt</code>. This is the file we will use on upload</p>
                    <pre>$ # write your post into a file called data.txt&#13;&#10;$ echo -n "This is my first post" > data.txt&#13;&#10;$ # create your signature&#13;&#10;$ openssl dgst -sha1 -sign postpigeon-priv-key.pem < data.txt > data.sig&#13;&#10;$ # base64 encode the signature (this is the bit we upload along with our data.txt file)&#13;&#10;$ cat data.sig | base64&#13;&#10;MIGGAkEJadmMV73C4pQVGUtmaTuzO/GjoAi1TWlqSNn6jaPKaCDiFANgfETf1TmgJAXDNhaWk00bgJBJqQji4QiyWo2ij9/P+Fc0PIXy1ymYScN0ZbX1YyMMQv+63C8UZIAnNZ6ZKgskOQD7JgImp4R3OPI6wGBt83DmtQ=</pre>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <h5>Verify your Signature</h5>
                    <p>If you'd like, you can verify the signature of your to-be-published post after you've created it</p>
                    <pre>$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify postpigeon-pub-key.pem -signature data.sig < data.txt&#13;&#10;Verified OK</pre>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <h5>Generate the Fingerprint of your Public Key</h5>
                    <p>Post Pigeon relies on the fingerprint of your key for lots of things. It's best to think of it as your username</p>
                    <p>The command below simply parses your key from your .pem, calculates the sha256 and Base64 encodes in a URL safe way</p>
                    <p>For convenience, you can also get your fingerprint from your public key through our <a href="/search/users">search page.</a></p>
                    <pre>$ cat postpigeon-pub-key.pem | sed '1,1d' | sed '$ d' | tr -d '\n' | base64 --decode | sha256sum | xxd -r -p | basenc --base64url&#13;&#10;FInWS6T-2_tTfzCteUyK0rQJelfKw7b9vhD6QlFiaoM=</pre>
                </div>

                <h2>Some Technical Considerations</h2>
                <h5>Design</h5>
                <p>We parse all markdown content on upload into HTML and use SQLite as a db/document store for our posts. On fetch requests, we return the pre-parsed posts directly from SQLite.</p>
                <p>As previously mentioned, most all endpoints return HTML directly from the server. The totality of our Javascript usage is contained <a href="https://github.com/jtanza/post-pigeon/blob/main/public/script.js">here.</a></p>

                <div id="content_uuids">
                    <h5>UUIDS</h5>
                    <p>UUIDs of posts are deterministically generated from the post title and the authors public key. This means if you delete a post and re-create it with the same key and title, you get the same UUID.</p>
                    <p>This also means that if you try to publish the same post twice (with the same key and title) you get a 4xx. Said differently, no duplicate posts are allowed.</p>
                    <p>This also has the added benefit that edits can be made to a post via a delete and re-create process: so long as the titles remain the same you can delete and re-submit a post with edited content and ensure the UUIDS are preserved (and therefore its URL).</p>
                    <p>You can always grab the UUID of a post from it URL, e.g. <code>/posts/{post-uuid}</code></p>
                </div>
                <br>

                <h5>Deletion</h5>
                <p>When we save a post, we store along with it the original message content and the public key used. This is done intentionally, so that on delete we use the <strong>stored</strong> public key of the requested post to verify the signed message.</p>
                <p>In effect this means that only the user who originally authored the post with the stored key can delete it.</p>

                <h5>Keys</h5>
                <div id="content_keys">
                    <p>Post Pigeon of course has no way of verifying that the current holder of the private key is the same individual who initially signed the post. In practice this means that whoever holds the keys used to sign a post is the de-facto owner of that post on Post Pigeon</p>
