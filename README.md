## Running Locally

Running locally should be pretty straight forward. You'll need Go and SQLite and that's basically it.

Clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jtanza/post-pigeon.git && cd post-pigeon
```
Create your db
```shell
$ touch postpigeon.db
$ sqlite3 postpigeon.db < migrations/1_add_init_tables.up.sql
```
Set your SHA1 namespace
```shell
$ export POST_PIGEON_NS="whatever.youd.like.uuid"
```
Run the app
```shell
$ go run cmd/api/main.go
```
